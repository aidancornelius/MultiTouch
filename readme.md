# MultiTouch for MacOS

This utility reads the multitouch input from a Mac compatible trackpad (laptop, Magic Trackpad, etc) and reports on it. I have also built some 
rudimentary functionality to send this via OpenSoundControl in the vein hope of having a TUIO compatible dollar store touch surface on a Mac.

## TODO

- At the moment velocity is not functional. 
- Interface cleanup is pretty badly needed.
- Would be great to work out how to use GC to capture the input so MacOS doesn't override gestures.
